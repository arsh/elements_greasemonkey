euclids_elements_greasemonkey_script

Simple script for reading euclid's elements book at
http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html
that will WHEN READY along the definitions and postulates links
give the text fot it.

Let's say you're reading a proposition that make use of 3 postulates by number, and 3 definitions which you don't remember, but they put the links within the page, so this script will get the text for those postulates and definitions.
